# Library Mini Project
Mini projects from Odin Web Development courses

This project is a library book inventory app. User will enter a new book and it will be displayed on the table. 

Each book can be removed and the read status can be toggled (read/unread)

This project teaches:
* Manipulating DOM
* Using click and submit(form) event listeners
* Using JS object constructor function for structuring data
* Using JS's modal as an input prompt(a form) which the default behavior for submission has been turned off (reset the page after submission which will remove data as no local storage is used)
